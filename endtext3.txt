Clean, unpolluted seas and greenery surround your town, attracting tourists to admire the beauty. However, the increase in tourism has led to a rise in littering and existing available accommodation is now limited and struggling to keep up with demand as the population rises.
Industry growth has created new jobs for citizens, and the economy is growing. This rapid growth has led to overpopulation and an increase in pollution, but you have managed to avoid letting this occur near essential water supplies, and most of the environment so far remains fairly undisturbed.
Your views on the environment clashed with a rival politician. While you have prioritized water sustainability, some citizens are disappointed that this has led to underwhelming improvements in other areas of society, such as infrastructure and education.
The focus on environmental protection and water sustainability has been beneficial to the townâ€™s growth. However, the overabundance of nature has led to increased scenarios of human and animal interaction and coexistence, causing a slight rise in situations such as traffic accidents or animal aggression.
The town is tidy and environmentally friendly but is still lacking infrastructure growth in vital areas, including hospitals and school buildings. This has caused stress and increased risk for citizens having to travel further for these services.
